python-hiera
============
python-hiera is a key/value lookup tool for configuration data. It is based of the puppet version of heira.
this module is written in pure python and does not use subprocess to execute hiera. It does not use hiera.yaml
or the cli configuration file. It will use its own but the layout is very similiar.
